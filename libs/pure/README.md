# pure

Collection of javascript libraries used internally in my projects.

These are inherently unstable. However if you want, you can depend on it
either by copying them into your project or use other creative methods.

Some libraries have external dependencies, which you want to state in the `package.json`
of your project. This repo doesn't have one :)

## Libraries
- `fs`: Browser File System Integration
- `log`: Logging library with log export ability
- `result`: Rust-list result handling library
- `utils`: I don't know where to put the stuff
