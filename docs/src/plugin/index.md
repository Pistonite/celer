# Plugins
This section contains guides for how to utilize Celer's plugin system to add
extra features to your route doc.

Start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) to get a basic understanding
of what plugins can do in Celer. Then you can take a look at the built-in plugins
like the [Link Plugin](./link.md).
