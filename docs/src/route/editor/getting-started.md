# Getting Started
Celer comes with an Editor that runs in the browser and lets you preview the project that you are making changes to.

To use it, simply head to [scheme://celer.placeholder.domain/edit](scheme://celer.placeholder.domain/edit)

## Workflows
The editor supports 2 workflows:
1. **Web editor**: You make changes to the project files in the browser. The changes can be automatically saved to your file system. *Recommended for everyone, supported browsers only*.
2. **External editor**: You make changes to the project files in an external text editor/IDE (VS Code, Emacs, Vim/Neovim...), and the browser will automatically recompile the route on change. *Recommended to people who are comfortable writing code*.


To switch the workflow:
1. Click on <FluentIcon name="Settings20Regular"/> `Settings` on the Toolbar.
2. Select the <FluentIcon name="Code20Regular" /> `Editor` category.
3. Under `General`, use the `Workflow` drop down to select the workflow.

## Next
Once you decided on the workflow, the [Web Editor](./web.md) or [External Editor](./external.md)
page will guide you through what you need to do to get started.
