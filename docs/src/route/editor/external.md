# External Editor
This workflow is meant for people who wish to edit the files with another program,
and for those whose environment doesn't support the web editor.

## Open a project
A project is a folder on your PC. Follow the steps to open a project.
:::tip
You can choose any folder if you are just testing. Or, skip ahead to [this section](../hello-world.md)
where step-by-step instructions are given for creating a minimal project folder.
:::

1. Click on <FluentIcon name="FolderOpen20Regular" /> `Open project` on the Toolbar.
2. Select the project folder in the dialog opened.
3. If asked for permissions to read and write to the file system, grant the permission.
4. If you see any error, follow the instruction in the error message.
5. The compiler should start running, and you should see the doc and map after it's done.

## Compiling the route
The browser will watch for changes you made to the file and automatically recompile.
The <FluentIcon name="ArrowSync20Regular" /> icon will
spin when the compiler is running. You can also click on it to manually trigger a compilation.
