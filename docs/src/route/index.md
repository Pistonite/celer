# Writing Routes
This section contains everything you need to write a route doc in Celer.

Start with [YAML Basics](./yaml-basics.md) if you are not familiar with
the YAML language. Otherwise, start with [Getting Started](./getting-started.md).

If you have used the old Celer, you may find a lot of the syntax/format the same.
However, it is recommended to skim through the documentation, since there are
upgrades and (breaking) changes to the syntax.
