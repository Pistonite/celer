# Writing Routes
You are now ready to create your own route in Celer!

First, head over to [Using the Editor](./editor/getting-started.md) to
get familiar with the tools.

After that, you can starting looking into how to set up a project:
- Start with [YAML Basics](./yaml-basics.md) if you are not familiar with
the YAML language. 
- Otherwise, start with the ["Hello, World!"](./hello-world.md) example.

:::tip
If you have used the old Celer, you may find a lot of the syntax/format the same.
However, it is recommended to skim through the documentation, since there are
upgrades and (breaking) changes to the syntax.
