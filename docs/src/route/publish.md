# Publish the Route
To publish or share your route, you need to upload it to GitHub. Everyone can then use Celer to view it. You need a GitHub account for this.

## How it works (Git basics)
1. You will create a repository on GitHub, which will become a copy of your project on GitHub.
2. Upload (push) your local folder to the repository.
3. When someone views a published route on Celer, Celer queries GitHub for the route files
4. When you want to update the route, change the files and push those changes to GitHub.
5. Everyone will see the updated route on Celer.

## Creating the repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new to start creating a new repository
2. Enter a name under `Repository name`. Note the following:
   - It is the best for your repository name to only contain alphanumeric characters (`a-z`, `A-Z` and `0-9`), `_` and `-`. Special characters like `%` or unicode characters will cause inconvienience.
3. Make sure the new repository will be `public`. Celer cannot access your private repositories.
4.
